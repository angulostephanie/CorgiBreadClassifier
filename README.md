# COMP 317 - Final Project
A program that classifies images into two categories: corgis or bread.

Inside this zip file, you will find:
* (**Constants.m**) A file with constants that are used throughout the project.
* (**preprocessImages.m**) A file that resizes images and catches corrupted/non-RBG images.
* (**CorgiBreadClassifier.m**) A function that creates the CNN.
